## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in hc-enterprise-kg, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email security concerns to the maintainers via the contact information on the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/thehipsterciso).

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix or mitigation**: As soon as practical, depending on severity

## Scope

This project generates **synthetic data** and processes **user-provided data** (CSV, text). Security considerations include:

- **Code injection**: The auto-extraction pipeline processes user-supplied text and CSV files. We sanitize inputs but welcome reports of bypass vectors.
- **LLM prompt injection**: When `--use-llm` is enabled, user-supplied text is sent to an LLM. Adversarial inputs could manipulate extraction results.
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: We track dependencies via Dependabot and welcome reports of vulnerable transitive dependencies.

## Out of Scope

- The synthetic data generated by this tool is fictional. It does not represent real people, organizations, or systems.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies should be reported upstream.
